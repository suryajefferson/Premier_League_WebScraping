**Hey there!**

Welcome to the Football Data Scraper project! This is a fun and practical tool that automates the process of collecting football match data from a website. I hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as I enjoyed building it. Itâ€™s a great way to see how web scraping and data handling can come together to provide useful insights.
